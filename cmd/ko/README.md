# `ko`

`ko` is a CLI to support rapid development of Go containers
with Kubernetes and minimal configuration.

## Installation

`ko` can be installed via:

```shell
go get github.com/google/go-containerregistry/cmd/ko
```

To update your installation:

```shell
go get -u github.com/google/go-containerregistry/cmd/ko
```

## The `ko` Model

`ko` is built around a very simple extension to Go's model for expressing
dependencies using [import paths](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#ImportPaths).

In Go, dependencies are expressed via blocks like:

```go
import (
    "github.com/google/go-containerregistry/pkg/authn"
    "github.com/google/go-containerregistry/pkg/name"
)
```

Similarly (as you can see above), Go binaries can be referenced via import
paths like `github.com/google/go-containerregistry/cmd/ko`.

**One of the goals of `ko` is to make containers invisible infrastructure.**
Simply replace image references in your Kubernetes yaml with the import path for
your Go binary, and `ko` will handle containerizing and publishing that
container image as needed.

For example, you might use the following in a Kubernetes `Deployment` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-world
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello-world
        # This is the import path for the Go binary to build and run.
        image: github.com/mattmoor/examples/http/cmd/helloworld
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

### Determining supported import paths

Similar to other tooling in the Go ecosystem, `ko` expects to execute in the
context of your `$GOPATH`. This is used to determine what package(s) `ko`
is expected to build.

Suppose `GOPATH` is `~/gopath` and the current directory is
`~/gopath/src/github.com/mattmoor/examples`. `ko` will deduce the base import
path to be `github.com/mattmoor/examples`, and any references to subpackages
of this will be built, containerized and published.

For example, any of the following would be matched:
* `github.com/mattmoor/examples`
* `github.com/mattmoor/examples/cmd/foo`
* `github.com/mattmoor/examples/bar`

### Results

Employing this convention enables `ko` to have effectively zero configuration
and enable very fast development iteration. For
[warm-image](https://github.com/mattmoor/warm-image), `ko` is able to
build, containerize, and redeploy a non-trivial Kubernetes controller app in
seconds (dominated by two `go build`s).

## Usage

`ko` has four commands, most of which build and publish images as part of
their execution.  By default, `ko` publishes images to a Docker Registry
specified via `KO_DOCKER_REPO`.

However, these same commands can be directed to operate locally as well via
the `--local` or `-L` command (or setting `KO_DOCKER_REPO=ko.local`).  See
the [`minikube` section](./README.md#with-minikube) for more detail.


### `ko publish`

`ko publish` simply builds and publishes images for each import path passed as
an argument. It prints the images' published digests after each image is published.

```shell
$ ko publish github.com/mattmoor/warm-image/cmd/sleeper
2018/07/19 14:57:34 Using base gcr.io/distroless/base:latest for github.com/mattmoor/warm-image/cmd/sleeper

```

`ko publish` also supports relative import paths, when in the context of a repo on `GOPATH`.

$ ko publish ./cmd/sleeper

```

### `ko resolve`

`ko resolve` takes Kubernetes yaml files in the style of `kubectl apply`
and (based on the [model above](#the-ko-model)) determines the set of
Go import paths to build, containerize, and publish.

The output of `ko resolve` is the concatenated yaml with import paths
replaced with published image digests. Following the example above,
this would be:

```shell
# Command
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value core/project)
export KO_DOCKER_REPO="gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}"
ko resolve -f deployment.yaml

# Output
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-world
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello-world
        # This is the digest of the published image containing the go binary.
        image: gcr.io/your-project/helloworld-badf00d@sha256:deadbeef
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

Some Docker Registries (e.g. gcr.io) support multi-level repository names.  For
these registries, it is often useful for discoverability and provenance to
preserve the full import path, for this we expose `--preserve-import-paths`,
or `-P` for short.

```shell
# Command
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value core/project)
export KO_DOCKER_REPO="gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}"
ko resolve -P -f deployment.yaml

# Output
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-world
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello-world
        # This is the digest of the published image containing the go binary
        # at the embedded import path.
        image: gcr.io/your-project/github.com/mattmoor/examples/http/cmd/helloworld@sha256:deadbeef
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

It is notable that this is not the default (anymore) because certain popular
registries (including Docker Hub) do not support multi-level repository names.

### `ko apply`

`ko apply` is intended to parallel `kubectl apply`, but acts on the same
resolved output as `ko resolve` emits. It is expected that `ko apply` will act
as the vehicle for rapid iteration during development. As changes are made to a
particular application, you can run: `ko apply -f unit.yaml` to rapidly
rebuild, repush, and redeploy their changes.

`ko apply` will invoke `kubectl apply` under the covers, and therefore apply
to whatever `kubectl` context is active.

### `ko delete`

`ko delete` simply passes through to `kubectl delete`. It is exposed purely out
of convenience for cleaning up resources created through `ko apply`.


## With `minikube`

You can use `ko` with `minikube` via a Docker Registry, but this involves
publishing images only to pull them back down to your machine again.  To avoid
this, `ko` exposes `--local` or `-L` options to instead publish the images to
the local machine's Docker daemon.

This would look something like:

```shell
# Use the minikube docker daemon.
eval $(minikube docker-env)

# Make sure minikube is the current kubectl context.
kubectl config use-context minikube

# Deploy to minikube w/o registry.
ko apply -L -f config/

# This is the same as above.
KO_DOCKER_REPO=ko.local ko apply -f config/
```

A caveat of this approach is that it will not work if your container is
configured with `imagePullPolicy: Always` because despite having the image
locally, a pull is performed to ensure we have the latest version, it still
exists, and that access hasn't been revoked. A workaround for this is to
use `imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent`, which should work well with `ko` in
all contexts.

Images will appear in the Docker daemon as `ko.local/import.path.com/foo/cmd/bar`.
With `--local` import paths are always preserved (see `--preserve-import-paths`).

## Configuration via `.ko.yaml`

While `ko` aims to have zero configuration, there are certain scenarios where
you will want to override `ko`'s default behavior. This is done via `.ko.yaml`.

`.ko.yaml` is put into the directory from which `ko` will be invoked. If it
is not present, then `ko` will rely on its default behaviors.

### Overriding the default base image

By default, `ko` makes use of `gcr.io/distroless/base:latest` as the base image
for containers. There are a wide array of scenarios in which overriding this
makes sense, for example:
1. Pinning to a particular digest of this image for repeatable builds,
1. Replacing this streamlined base image with another with better debugging
  tools (e.g. a shell, like `docker.io/library/ubuntu`).

The default base image `ko` uses can be changed by simply adding the following
line to `.ko.yaml`:

```yaml
defaultBaseImage: gcr.io/another-project/another-image@sha256:deadbeef
```

### Overriding the base for particular imports

Some of your binaries may have requirements that are a more unique, and you
may want to direct `ko` to use a particular base image for just those binaries.

The base image `ko` uses can be changed by adding the following to `.ko.yaml`:

```yaml
baseImageOverrides:
  github.com/my-org/my-repo/path/to/binary: docker.io/another/base:latest
```

### Why isn't `KO_DOCKER_REPO` part of `.ko.yaml`?

Once introduced to `.ko.yaml`, you may find yourself wondering: Why does it
not hold the value of `$KO_DOCKER_REPO`?

The answer is that `.ko.yaml` is expected to sit in the root of a repository,
and get checked in and versioned alongside your source code. This also means
that the configured values will be shared across developers on a project, which
for `KO_DOCKER_REPO` is actually undesireable because each developer is (likely)
using their own docker repository and cluster.


## Including static assets

A question that often comes up after using `ko` for a while is: "How do I
include static assets in images produced with `ko`?".

For this, `ko` builds around an idiom similar to `go test` and `testdata/`.
`ko` will include all of the data under `<import path>/kodata/...` in the
images it produces.

These files are placed under `/var/run/ko/...`, but the appropriate mechanism
for referencing them should be through the `KO_DATA_PATH` environment variable.
The intent of this is to enable users to test things outside of `ko` as follows:

```shell
KO_DATA_PATH=$PWD/cmd/ko/test/kodata go run ./cmd/ko/test/*.go
2018/07/19 23:35:20 Hello there
```

This produces identical output to being run within the container locally:

```shell
ko publish -L ./cmd/ko/test

## Relevance to Release Management

`ko` is also useful for helping manage releases. For example, if your project
periodically releases a set of images and configuration to launch those images
on a Kubernetes cluster, release binaries may be published and the configuration
generated via:

```shell
export PROJECT_ID=<YOUR RELEASE PROJECT>
export KO_DOCKER_REPO="gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}"
ko resolve -f config/ > release.yaml
```

> Note that in this context it is recommended that you also provide `-P`, if
> supported by your Docker registry. This improves users' ability to tie release
> binaries back to their source.

This will publish all of the binary components as container images to
`gcr.io/my-releases/...` and create a `release.yaml` file containing all of the
configuration for your application with inlined image references.

This resulting configuration may then be installed onto Kubernetes clusters via:

```shell
kubectl apply -f release.yaml
```
