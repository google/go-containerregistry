## crane push

Push local image contents to a remote registry

### Synopsis

If the PATH is a directory, it will be read as an OCI image layout. Otherwise, PATH is assumed to be a docker-style tarball.

```
crane push PATH IMAGE [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help                help for push
      --image-refs string   path to file where a list of the published image references will be written
      --index               push a collection of images as a single index, currently required if PATH contains multiple images
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --insecure            Allow image references to be fetched without TLS
      --platform platform   Specifies the platform in the form os/arch[/variant][:osversion] (e.g. linux/amd64). (default all)
  -v, --verbose             Enable debug logs
```
