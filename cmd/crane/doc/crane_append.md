## crane append

Append contents of a tarball to a remote image

### Synopsis

This sub-command pushes an image based on an (optional)
base image, with appended layers containing the contents of the
provided tarballs.

If the base image is a Windows base image (i.e., its config.OS is "windows"),
the contents of the tarballs will be modified to be suitable for a Windows
container image.
