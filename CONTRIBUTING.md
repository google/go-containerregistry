Contributions to any Google project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement.  This is not a copyright **assignment**, it simply gives Google permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one. You may make a pull request before you have signed a CLA, but the request will not be merged until you have.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.
